- 👀 I’m interested in supporting customers to be the best they can be and supporting my teams to be the best engineering teams on the planet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of moving from Agile DevOps to GitHub. IoT, Infrastructure as code, Agile coaching, economic development in the digital covid era, political economy, and psychology’s impact on technology.
